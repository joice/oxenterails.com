          Thais Camilo
      %p
        The path that led Thais to her passion for Ruby on Rails began with her learning Perl to organize her extensive book and music collections. This quickly led her to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (rather than taking over the family business) and to work with software development in C, Perl, Python and PHP. She then journeyed to explore some Java until finally finding (and falling in love with) Ruby on Rails. Born Brazilian, she moved to Chile to become a Rocketeer and feel the snow for the first time in the Andes. She loves helping people, never refraining from teaching whatever is necessary to whoever needs it. In her free time she likes to ride her bike, run, and practice Krav Magá. Despite being a Krav Magá practitioner, she swears she is a gentle person. Oh, and don't be afraid if she hugs you when you first meet her.
